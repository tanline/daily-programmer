These are my solutions for programming problems posted on [r/dailyprogrammer](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer).

The goal is to create a solution for at least one problem per week.

This will give me a chance to help strengthen my knowledge of certain languages, as well as provide a good way to experiment with new ones.
